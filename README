Use MPO Tool to convert MPO to JPS.

Dependencies Ubuntu/Debian:
gir1.2-gexiv2-0.4
libgexiv2-dev
python-imaging
python-gi

Progressbar does not work yet, so just be patient - the application works - have
a look in your target folder and you will see the progress.

Start MPO Tool in its folder with ./mpo-tool-gui.py from the commandline.
You will see the GUI and get progress information in your terminal.
