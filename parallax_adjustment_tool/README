Use MPO Tppl to convert MPO to JPS. You have to install Python Imaging Library
or 'sudo apt-get install python-imaging' as well as 'python-gi'.

Progressbar does not work yet, so just be patient - the application works - have
a look in your target folder and you will see the progress.

Start MPO Tool in its folder with ./mpo-tool-gui.py from the commandline.
You will see the GUI and get progress information in your terminal.
